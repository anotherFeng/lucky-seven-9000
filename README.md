# lucky-seven
Lucky-Seven was one of the very first javascript apps I made.  It originally contained 124 lines of code including html, css, and javascript.  
The mission here is to overcomplicate this 124 lines of code app as much as I possibly can.
So I turned it into a microservices, 
dockerized it and push them to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with RDS taking care of the postgres database, and ElastiCache running the redis instance.
