# lucky-seven
Lucky-Seven was one of the very first javascript apps I made.  It originally contain a 124 lines of code including html, css, and javascript.  
The mission here is to overcomplicate this 124 lines of code app as much as I possibly can.
So I turned it into a microservices, 
connect this repo to travis,
dockerized it and push them to dockerhub,
implemented redis for caching play history using elastic cache,
postgres for storing.... well, things, using AWS RDS
we will have a worker server to take care of the calculation,
and application will be hosted at elastic beanstalk.
